## 🚀 **Quick Start**

```bash
# Install globally (one-time setup)
chmod +x setup_ai_docs_globally.sh
./setup_ai_docs_globally.sh
source ~/.bashrc

# Use in any new project
mkdir my-new-project && cd my-new-project
create-ai-docs.py .

# Copy templates to project root
cp -r universal-ai-docs/* .
rm -rf universal-ai-docs/

# Customize docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT_PRIMING.md and start coding!
```

## ✨ **What You Get**

### **Core Templates:**
- 📝 **`PROJECT_CONTEXT_PRIMING.md`** - Complete AI agent context template
- 🏗️ **`architecture_overview.md`** - System architecture documentation
- 📋 **`README.md`** - Professional project overview template
- ⚙️ **`implementation_patterns.mdc`** - Three-phase development methodology
- 📖 **`USAGE_GUIDE.md`** - Step-by-step implementation guide
- 🚀 **`setup_new_project.py`** - Automated project setup script

### **Development Methodology:**
**Three-Phase Implementation Strategy** (extracted from successful projects):
1. **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Implementation (30% effort)** - Get basic functionality working
2. **Phase 2: Business Requirements (40% effort)** - Add security, compliance, error handling  
3. **Phase 3: Production Hardening (30% effort)** - Monitoring, optimization, full testing

## 🎯 **Key Benefits**

- ⚡ **30-60 minutes** from idea to productive development environment
- 🤖 **Instant AI agent onboarding** with comprehensive context
- 📏 **Consistent quality** across all your projects
- 🛡️ **Anti-over-engineering** patterns and progressive methodology
- ✅ **Built-in best practices** for testing, documentation, and architecture
- 🔄 **Reuse-first principles** to avoid duplicate work

## 📚 **Documentation**

- **[Complete Usage Guide](HOW_TO_USE_AI_DOCS_GENERATOR.md)** - Detailed instructions and examples
- **[Installation Guide](#installation)** - Setup options
- **[Template Reference](#template-reference)** - What each template provides
- **[AI Agent Integration](#ai-agent-integration)** - How to onboard AI agents effectively

## 🛠️ **Installation**

### **Option 1: Global Installation (Recommended)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/universal-ai-docs-generator.git
cd universal-ai-docs-generator
chmod +x setup_ai_docs_globally.sh
./setup_ai_docs_globally.sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

### **Option 2: Per-Project Installation**
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/universal-ai-docs-generator/main/create_universal_ai_docs.py
python create_universal_ai_docs.py
```

### **Option 3: Direct Download**
Download `create_universal_ai_docs.py` and run it in your project directory.

## 🤖 **AI Agent Integration**

After customizing the templates, onboard any AI coding agent with this prompt:

```
Please read these files to understand this project:
1. docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT_PRIMING.md - Complete project context
2. README.md - Project overview and setup
3. docs/architecture_overview.md - System architecture
4. .cursor/rules/implementation_patterns.mdc - Development patterns

This is a [your_project_type] system where [key_constraints] are as important as technical functionality. Please help me implement [specific_feature] using the three-phase approach.
```
